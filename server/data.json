Happily, there are two additional offerings in the Phantom family: a coupe and the drophead—Brit-speak for softtop. Both are based on a shortened Phantom chassis and seat four. The coupe offers an LED Starlight headliner option that brings the constellations inside. The drophead is inspired by 1930s yacht design, with a lined fabric top and optional teak decking. So, will it be Starlight or real stars?",

In our test the P90D went from 0 to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds and has a 250-mile range; Tesla says the P100D hits 60 mph in 2.9 seconds and has a 289-mile range. The 75D and 90D have 238 and 257 miles of range; both are slower to 60 mph. The X is actually practical, with all-wheel drive, a high-tech cabin, and the striking but fussy Falcon Wing doors. Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving is optional.",

Icing on the cake is Ludicrous mode that blasts the top P100D to 60 mph in a claimed 2.5 seconds. The lower-spec models offer reduced driving ranges and features, but the base 60 model we tested hit 60 mph in 5.5 seconds.
